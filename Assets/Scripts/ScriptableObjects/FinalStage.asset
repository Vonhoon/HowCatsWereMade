  dialoguesEN:
  - Great job! It's shame that the big ones are gone now.
  - But still we have small ones and those flying creatures.
  - I've scolded the noob enough so... I hope it won't happen again
  - Anyhow... you see that aggressive looking creature, wrap around in leather?
  - That thing has confined our cute wildcat
  - and even trying to kill one right now!
  - They need your HELP!
  - I don't know what will happen to this world
  - if those aggressive creatures over populate in this world...
