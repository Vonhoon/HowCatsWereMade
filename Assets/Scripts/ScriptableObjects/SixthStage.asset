  dialoguesEN:
  - This place needs your attention it seems
  - That cute yellow creature
  - has contributed so much without you knowing!
  - All it did was feed itself and others
  - according to his instincts.
  - It has transported pollens everywhere!
  - It's almost like it's broken.
  - Oh, why don't we call them "BUGS"?
  - Help the bug reach the tree over there!
