  - OMG!
  - Some noob just hurled a couple of giant rocks at our planet
  - I know it's a mistake and everyone makes mistakes but...
  - The explosion it caused is so bad,
  - it will setback our progress by a billion year...
  - But don't give up, we still have hope.
  - Try to save as many smaller folks as possible
  - They have better chance to survive!
