  dialoguesEN:
  - Great Job! Look at the creations you made!
  - ... Wait, WHAT??
  - It seems we can give them new abilities with our new tile!
  - It will be a whole new "PERSPECTIVE" for our creations!
  - Oh, and one advice. You can manipulate tiles even *AFTER* play button press.
    Make use of that!
