  dialoguesEN:
  - AMAZING! That's almost like a miracle
  - These cells... made from dirt?
  - They are wiggly and So CUTE!
  - But they still can't move in directions without YOUR help.
  - Let's try using a different ability.
  - SPACE-TIME MANIPULATION!
  - ... sorry, I'm just kidding.
  - It's just a Play button.
  - And... We got a new tile to play around with!
  - HAVE FUN!
